# static_online_shoping_website

This repository contains a simple static online shopping website mockup created for an assignment.

Included files:

- `home.html` — Home page with navigation and featured items
- `catalogue.html` — Catalogue of products (grid of product cards)
- `cart.html` — Static cart example showing items and total
- `login.html` — Login form (no JavaScript)
- `signup.html` — Registration form (no JavaScript)
- `styles.css` — Shared stylesheet used by the pages
- `assignment.pdf` — PDF summary of the assignment (generated by `generate_pdf.py`)

How to view locally:

- Open `home.html` (or any other `.html` file) in a browser; no server is required for static viewing.

Deploying with GitHub Pages:

- Option A (simplest): In GitHub, go to repository Settings → Pages and set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)`. After a minute it will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` (replace with your username and repository name).
- Option B: Put the files in a `docs/` folder and choose `main` branch → `docs/` as the Pages source in repository settings.

Notes:

- No JavaScript files are included — the site is intentionally basic and only uses HTML and CSS.
- The `assignment.pdf` file contains a short description of the project and instructions.

If you want, I can also push these changes to the GitHub repo and help enable GitHub Pages (requires GitHub authentication).
